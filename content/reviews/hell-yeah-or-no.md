This is literally a printed version of [Derek](../../individuals/derek-sivers.md)’s blog posts, so taking notes myself would be kinda useless here. Also the posts/chapters are very condensed, to a point were further summarising would not be possible without losing information.

The articles featured in the book, as well as where to get it, are linked on [Derek’s website](https://sive.rs/).
