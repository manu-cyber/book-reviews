> Behind many of our problems lies an often ignored factor: we don’t like ourselves very much. We are sufferers of self-hatred. We tell ourselves the meanest things. It’s because of self-hatred that we tend to neglect our potential at work and get entangled in unfulfilling relationships, that we lack confidence in our social lives and suffer from anxiety and despair.

Nothing really revolutionary. A good starting point for people who haven’t really realized they’re actively self-hating yet, and/or to reflect a bit on past events. A few of those will unavoidably come to mind.

Maybe a good gift for people who didn’t have that realisation yet and  didn’t already work through it with a therapist.

The list of chapters sums it up pretty well:
- The Consequences of Self-Hatred
- The Origins of Self-Hatred
- The Art of Self-Acceptance
- Towards a More Self-Accepting Life
