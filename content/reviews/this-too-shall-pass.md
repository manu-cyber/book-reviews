I’m not exactly sure how I managed to stumble upon this book. I think I was browsing the [School of Life](https://www.theschooloflife.com/) catalogue, when I found the author’s name in some virtual live event they were hosting, and looked her up because I was interested in the topic.

I started out reading this with the intention to take extensive notes, but changed my mind when I was really exhausted after the first few reading sessions. I’m used to consuming and interacting in the English language, but this book makes use of a large vocabulary, and also just seems to be written in a manner that requires the reader to be pretty attentive in general. It could be this is due to my terrible attention span though.  
I also found that there’s not much practical advise or principles to write down—I probably misinterpreted the promise of the book here.

The book itself contains of multiple stories of selected patient’s therapy sessions, grouped by the topics they were struggling with. Those topics are family relationships, love, work, health and identity.  
The stories are beautifully written, and can prompt lots of reflection when the reader experienced similar situations in life, or is even stuck in one right now. I remember while reading myself, some childhood memories bubbled up seemingly at random, but I think I was realising in those moments that I misinterpreted their actual weight on my development and re-evaluated them in that moment. Some of those times I had to put the book aside to reflect on those memories and think a little more.  
A thing those stories all have in common is that they focus around change. Sometimes abrupt change, like a cancer diagnosis, or a forced retirement, and sometimes slower changes the pations weren’t consciously aware of, like a transition away from traditional family/cultural values and the likes. This change is really hard to deal with most of the time, and that adaption doesn’t happen from one day to another. It can require help.  
The stories describe the patient’s paths to this adaption, re-evaluation of their situation and exploration of new perspectives.

Every topic section is concluded by a few reflections on those changes, using the preceding stories as examples. They can help shed a new light on certain transitions that happen commonly in these areas of life.

A little practical guidance happens at the very end of the book. It’s still fairly abstract, and appears to me like a broad aggregation of tools and methods that can help on certain issues, and the reader is encouraged to pick and try some of those if they suspect them to be helpful. I would’t consider those to be revolutionary or secret techniques though, e.g. journalling is known to be helpful sorting out one’s thoughts and feelings.

To me this book doesn’t seem like the universal guide to bogged down life situations, but more like an amazing anchor to put your current situation into perspective. It’s a great reminder that changes, even the really challenging ones, are normal in human life, and every other human being has to deal with some of those.  
I would also imagine that while your waiting for a free slot for actual psychotherapy sessions, this book could prompt some valuable reflection beforehand and enable you to do some work on yourself even then, although it’s certainly not a replacement.

I hope my thoughts on this book are useful to someone. If you think I do this book injustice and didn’t really get it, please let me know. I’d love to know.
